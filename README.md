# Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

A project to create a game of **Rock, Paper, Scissors** that plays in a web browser.

Completed as part of the **JavaScript Basics** section of the **Foundation Course** at
[TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com).

---

## Initial Version

The initial version used JavaScript to create a game of **Rock, Paper, Scissors** that was played entirely in the
browser console.

Full details [available here &rArr;](./Initial.md)

## Revised Version

The revision added a ui to the project allowing the game to be played directly in the browser, rather than the console.

## Assignment Instructions

The [task description](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) includes a detailed
sequence of steps. Rather than strict adherence, the applied methodology will be to attempt to work independently toward
a solution.

However, of note are the following sections:

<table>
<tr>
<td>

in **Step 3: Write the logic to get the human choice**

</td>
<td>

> - Use the prompt method to get the user’s input.
> - You do not need to handle re-prompting if the user enters an invalid input ... just assume the user will always enter a valid choice.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

in **Step 4: Declare the players score variables**


</td>
<td>

> - The game will keep track of the players score.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

in **Step 6: Write the logic to play the entire game**


</td>
<td>

> - The game will play 5 rounds.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

## Results

~~Final page can be viewed live [here &rArr;](https://odinprojectassignmentsbypw80.github.io/javascript-basics_project-rps/). The prompts will start before you have a chance to open the console, however, pressing <kbd>F12</kbd> still works.~~

This version of the page is no longer live. It has been superseded by the newer version with a ui.
